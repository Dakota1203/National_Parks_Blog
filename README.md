# National_Parks_Blog

-What the project does: 

Get out there! An Adventure Blog, is a user-created blog website for national parks in the U.S.. The site lists selectable national parks in an "index" page along with some basic info, with the user-created blog entries in a separate "blog content" page.

-Why the project is useful: 

Get Out There! lets the user view blogs for a national park left by other users, as well as create thier own blog entries, or edit an existing blog. Each national park "details" page contains an image of the park, location, and a short description.

-How users can get started with the project: 

Once a user navigates to the site, they can choose a park from the index. From there, they can choose to create, edit, delete a blog entry, or read blog entries left by other users. Each page contains a link near the bottom of the page that will navigate back to the main listing, where they can choose to view other parks.

-Where users can get help with your project: 

If you encounter a bug while using the site, you can send an email with a description of the issue to dakotawhittle1203@gmail.com or dan.roman21@gmail.com
